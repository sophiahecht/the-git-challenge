#+TITLE: No Conflict Case

** The new option 'configure --with-mailutils' causes Emacs to rely on
default if GNU Mailutils is installed.  When --with-mailutils is not
in effect, the Emacs build procedure by default continues to build and
install a limited 'movemail' substitute that (I changed this line here) retrieves POP3 email only
via insecure channels; to avoid this problem, use either
--with-mailutils or --without-pop when configuring.

** The new option 'configure --enable-gcc-warnings=warn-only' causes
GCC to issue warnings without stopping the build.  This behavior is
now the default in developer builds.  As before, use
'--disable-gcc-warnings' to suppress GCC's warnings, and
'--enable-gcc-warnings' to stop the build if GCC issues warnings.

This is the line I add.
